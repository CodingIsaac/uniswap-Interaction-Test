# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates is a test we wrote at our bootcamp, WEB3BRIDGE.
Here are the questions:

1. Write a script that interacts with at least two write functions on the uniswap router.
2. Write a smart contract that does anything you desire and deploy it to the testnet, equally use the script to write a write function inm your smart contract.

The concern is how do you achieve this:
You must impersonate a user on mainnet and use the cloned account to write the functions
Then for the second question, you create a simple smart contract and interact with it on the testnet which is basic and easy.

Thank you.
